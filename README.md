## Security-patch.sh

## Overview

This repository contains a Bash script designed to automate the process of updating and patching security vulnerabilities in an Ubuntu system. The script creates two separate scriptsâ€”one for updating package information and another for applying security patches. Additionally, it sets up cron jobs to execute these scripts on a scheduled basis.

## Prerequisites

- The script assumes it is being run on an Ubuntu system.
- Ensure that the user running the script has sudo privileges.

## Instructions

**Step 1: Navigate to the Repository Directory**

```
cd ubuntu-tools
```

**Step 2: Make the Script Executable**

```
chmod +x security-patch.sh
```
3. **Run the script:**
    - Execute the script using the following command:

```
./security-patch.sh
```
4. **Review Cron Jobs:**
```
crontab -l
```

## Script Details

### Update Script (`update-packages.sh`)

- **Location:** `/home/ubuntu/ubuntu-tools/update-packages.sh`
- **Description:** This script updates the package information on the system.
- **Cron Job Schedule:** The script sets up a daily cron job to run the update script.
    - **Schedule:** Every day at midnight (`0 0 * * *`)

### Security Patch Script (`security-patch.sh`)

- **Location:** `/home/ubuntu/ubuntu-tools/security-patch.sh`
- **Description:** This script performs security updates, upgrades, removes unused packages, and reboots the system.
- **Cron Job Schedule:** The script sets up a cron job to run the security patch script every 15 days.
    - **Schedule:** Every 15 days at midnight (`0 0 */15 * *`)

## Notes

- Ensure that the specified directory (`/home/ubuntu/ubuntu-tools/`) exists on your system.
- The cron job schedules can be adjusted by modifying the `CRON_UPDATE_SCHEDULE` and `CRON_PATCH_SCHEDULE` variables in the script.

By following these steps, you will automate the process of keeping your Ubuntu system secure with regular security updates and patches.
